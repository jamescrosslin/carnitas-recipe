My recipe for awesome carnitas


```js
4 lbs pork butt
2 tablespoons ghee or unsalted lard (or some other high smoke point oil)
1.5 teaspoons kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon Thai fish sauce
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon cayenne powder
1/2 teaspoon tumeric
1 orange sliced into quarters
1 onion sliced into quarters
2 cups chicken stock (have extra on hand)
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke OR smoked paprika
1 large cast iron skillet, dutch oven or combination stovetop/ovenware with a heavy lid (or heavy duty tin foil)
```

1. Cut your pork but into manageable chunks about 5 inches by 5 inches. Coat the pork with al of the salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp of oil at a time in your pot over medium high heat. Sear your meat cubes on all sides, about 5 minutes per side until the meat is dark brown and lifts easily from the pot. Depending on the size of your pot, you may have to do 2 to 4 batches. If juice collects at the bottom of the pan that prevents a sear, remove the liquid between batches and re-grease the pot. If the bottom of your pot starts to get a little brown from searing the meat, don't remove the stuck on bits. Just add a little oil to keep them from turning black and acrid. When each batch is done, store it off to the side.

2. When you remove the last bit of seared meat from the pot, preheat your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Over medium heat, add the chicken stock to the empty pot and use a wooden spoon or other strong utensil to scrape the stuck on bits off the bottom of your pot. Squeeze your orange juice into the pot, and then place the rinds into the pot. Then add the remaining ingredients to the pot, stirring until well mixed. Add your pork to the pot, turn heat up to medium high and bring to a heavy simmer. The liquid should be about 1 inch under the top of the pork. If you have a little too much liquid, that's okay, but if there's not enough, add a quarter cup more stock or water. Then place a heavy lid on your pot and transfer your pot to the 300 degree oven. Cook 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until fork tender.

3. Remove from the oven and let sit for fat to rise to the top of the dish. Skim as much fat off the top as you can without removing the pork broth. Some fat is fine. Then, you can either store the meat over night in its liquid or cook some right out of the gate.

4. When you're ready to eat, set a rack in your oven to 6 inches from the broiler and turn your broiler to high, or if you don't have a broiler set your oven to bake at 475 degrees. Either chunk the desired amount of meat into 2 inch cubes or just pull meat apart slightly, and place it on a foil-covered baking sheet. Place it in the oven for 6 minutes and check on it. Your pork should be a medium brown color and crispy on the outside. If the pork still looks light colored or is not crispy to the touch, pop it back in for another minute and check again. Check every minute, as it can get too dry or crisp quickly. Serve however you like, it's delicious no matter what you do to it lol
